In this Project I creates BlacJack game.

The Rules:
  # Each participant receives 2 cards in the first round
  
  Player wins if the value of all of his cards counts to 21.
  In case there isn't a winner in there in the 1st round we will play rounds until one of thw following:
    1. 1 one or more players get to 21 in the same rpund
    2. only one player has left in the game ane he will be the winner.
    
    In each round player can choose
      1.hit - get anoter card
      2. stand - no to get a card
      3. split - in case the player holds 2 cards in the same value he i sallowed to split it into packs,
      and play it, is if it's a new player.(avalible only in thw 2nd round)
